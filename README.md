The corresponding neural network models can be found in the master branch of the repository. The weight file M4RawV1.5_Nafnet.pth was obtained by training a model with default parameters, using a batch size of 16, a maximum of 50 iterations, and a learning rate of 0.0001.

Similarly, the UNetWavelet.pth model was trained with a batch size of 16, a maximum of 50 iterations, a learning rate of 0.0001, and the nlayers parameter set to 12.

Additionally, the weight file fastMRI_banding_removel_Unet.pth was obtained through training with a batch size of 8, a maximum of 50 iterations, a learning rate of 0.0001, and incorporating 4 pooling layers.
